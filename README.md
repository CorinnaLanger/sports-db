## Overview

### The challenge

The overall view of the leagues should be able to be filtered by country and sport. Users can use a search function to find specific information. Clicking on a league takes you to a subpage listing all the clubs (playing in that league). From here you can click on the club and call up a detail page with information about the club.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
